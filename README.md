### Installation

1. Firstly, clone the repository or download its content from this page.

2. In order to run the application on our browser, we are required to set up a web server. One easy way to do it is by using the Python's built-in web server module, as follows:
    ``` sh
    $ cd Project
    $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
    ```
    
3. The server should now be open at the chosen port 8080.
Consequently, access it by typing the following in your browser's address bar:
    ```sh
    http://localhost:8080
    ```
   - *It is recommended the use of Google Chrome*


4. Select the **'code'** folder.
